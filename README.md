# Long term impact of giving antibiotics before skin incision versus after cord clamping on children born by caesarean section: longitudinal study based on UK electronic health records 

**In the UK, every one in four women give birth by caesarean section. In 2011, there was a change in the NICE guideline on caesarean section (CG132) recommending switching from giving antibiotics after the umbilical cord is cut to giving antibiotics before the operation to further reduce the risk of infection, such as wound infection, in mothers. 
There are no known short term harms to the baby or their mother having these antibiotics around the time of the birth.
There is, however, growing evidence of the role of the human microbiome (different microbes that live in and on our body) in health and disease. Antibiotics given around the time of birth, alter the gut microbiome of babies, which may impact on the development of the child’s immune system. Our research project aimed to assess if these antibiotics have any longer term impact on children’s health.**


This project draws on the growing strengths of the Institute of Applied Health Research in health informatics research (including policy evaluation using routine electronic healthcare data), biostatistics and maternal and child health. It used anonymised data from several sources, including two UK primary care databases and hospital episode statistics database for England.

## About this repository

This repository contains numerous clinical codes for primary care and secondary care that represents various disease conditions and treatment. These codes were used to identity exposure, outcomes and baseline conditions in mothers and babies for the project.
